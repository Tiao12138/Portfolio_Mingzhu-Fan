            A design research that employs a tangible interface which supports the user study designed 
            to find out whether the embodied metaphor1 can enhance people's perception of the 
            microtiming2 in grooves. According to the results, the tangible interface applied in this 
            study does not offer a significant advantage in improving individuals' perception of 
            microtiming in grooves but certain aspects of young individuals' ability to perceive timing 
            in grooves have been identified</br>

        <b>Musical groove is an abstract/ineffable concept related to body movement</b>
      </p>
      Musical “groove” is a pleasurable experience that arises from the interaction of rhythm and meter in music [4]. It is
      inseparable from bodily sensations, with a common definition as “how much the music makes you want to move” [5, 6].
      While there are slight variations in the definitions of the concept, musicians, music psychologists, and music scholars
      generally agree that the groove experience involves an individual's inner urge to align their body movements with the
      rhythm of the music.

      <p class="large2" style="text-decoration: underline;"><b><i>EXPERIMENT DESIGN</i></b></p>
      The overall goal is to find out whether embodied metaphor can enhance individual's perception of grooves. 
      To accomplish this, participants' perception of grooves will be evaluated in two scenarios: one group will
      experience embodied feelings with an artifact while it plays grooves with microtiming, the other group will engage 
      with an artifact without applying these embodied feelings. The participants' level of groove perception will be 
      assessed both before and after interacting with the artifacts to gauge any changes in perception.
      To measure how well the participants perceive the timing nuances in grooves, my intention is to present them with
      soundtracks containing timing deviations and ask them to determine whether they feel the groove is “ahead” when the
      instrument with timing deviation is early to the metronomic beat, or “on” when every instrument in the groove is on the
      metronomic beat, or “late” when the instrument with timing deviation is late.

      <p class="large2" style="text-decoration: underline; width: 100%;"><b><i>Materials--</i></b></p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><b style="width: 100%; color: #4191D8;">1 Soundtracks</b></br>16 soundtracks were created with a tempo of 96 bpm, 
        but have different styles like Bossa nova or Afrobeat etc., as well as different timing deviations(except No.7-10, Category "on").</p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><b style="width: 100%; color: #4191D8;">2 Tangible interface with embodied metaphors</b></br>
        A user interface is to be designed to enable people to experience the embodied feelings.
        <b>Pulling and pushing</b>, to me, have the most direct and easiest-to-imagine mapping with microtiming. To make it possible for users to 
        experience pushing and pulling feelings, A <b>tangible interface</b> is very important in this case.</p>
      <p style=" margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8rem; width: 100%; color: #4191D8;">
        <p><b>Pushing and pulling</b></p>
        <img src="images/p2-4/p2-4-22.png" alt="" class="col1pic">
        <p>An elastic band is utilized to keep the slider(a potentiometer slider) and strap centered, ensuring everything in the soundtrack 
        remains "on" when neither pushed nor pulled. Without manipulating the slider or strap, this device instructs the computer to play 
        a drumline and a bassline soundtrack in perfect synchronization. By pushing the slider, the bassline(e.g.) can be adjusted “earlier”
        than the drumline, making the whole groove <b>“ahead”</b>, giving <b>pushing</b> feelings. The farther it is from the initial center 
        position, the greater the timing deviation becomes. By pulling the strap, the bassline can be adjusted  “later” than the drumline, 
        making the whole groove <b>“late”</b>, <b>pulling</b>feelings. Again, the distance from the initial center position corresponds to 
        the magnitude of the timing deviation. The slider and strap positions are mapped to 13 different bassline timing deviations, which 
        include a deviation of 0ms (perfectly on the beat). The deviations are as follows: -156.3ms (1/4 beat), -117.2ms (3/16beat), -78.1ms 
        (1/8 beat), -52.1ms (1/12 beat), -39.1ms (1/16 beat), -26ms (1/24 beat), 0ms, +26ms (1/24 beat), +39.1ms (1/16 beat), 
        +52.1ms (1/12 beat), +78.1ms (1/8beat), +117.2ms (3/16 beat), and +156.3ms (1/4 beat).</p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><b style="width: 100%; color: #4191D8;">3 Digital interface</b></br>
        By clicking the "next" and "previous" buttons located at the bottom, you can adjust the time deviation of the bassline.
        A single click on the "next" button transitions the soundtrack to the closest "later" variation (e.g., from -117.2ms (3/16
        beat) to -78.1ms (1/8 beat), or from +39.1ms (1/16 beat) to +52.1ms (1/12 beat)), resulting in a "later" groove. Similarly,
        clicking the "previous" button once switches the soundtrack to the nearest "more ahead" variation, creating a "more ahead"
        groove. The "next" and "previous" buttons located above are specifically used for switching between the different
        drumlines.

    <img src="images/p2-4/p2-4-26.png" alt="" class="col1pic">
    <p>After the experiment, participants' answers of "ahead", "late" and "on" were checked and analyzed.</p>

      <img src="images/p2-4/p2-4-20.png" alt="" class="col1pic" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
      <p style="margin-top: 0rem;">The experimental group exhibited a slightly greater improvement in their perception of microtiming. 
        The improvement is very small, it cannot strongly support tangible interfaces with embodied metaphor can enhance people's 
        perception of grooves. Further research and validation are required to support this assertion conclusively.</p>
        <img src="images/p2-4/p2-4-28.png" alt="" class="col1pic" style="margin-top: 4rem; margin-bottom: 0;">
       <p style="margin-top: 0rem;"> Moreover, the data indicates a strong correlation between participants' music knowledge and the correct rate. A notable
        disparity is observed when comparing the correct rate of the five participants with a higher level of music knowledge to
        that of the remaining participants.</br></br></br>
        Not surprisingly, almost all participants were observed engaging in body movements while listening to the
        soundtracks. They exhibited behaviors such as nodding their heads, tapping their fingers, and patting their feet, all in an
        effort to synchronize with the beat. These movements varied in intensity, ranging from subtle finger movements to more
        pronounced actions. For instance, one participant intentionally tapped their feet, creating loud sounds, while
        simultaneously moving their entire body. These observations support the previous assertion that body movements serve as
        a visceral response to the grooves, and individuals sometimes intentionally engage in such movements to enhance their
        perception of timing of the grooves.</br>
