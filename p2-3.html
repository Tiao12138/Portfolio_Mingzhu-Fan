        <p>Our project brief from Trust-M states that Espoo is a rapidly growing city, with 
        foreign speakersaccounting for 20% of the population. The forecast suggests this figure will rise to over 30% by 2035.
        The city's strategy places a strong emphasis on the integration of immigrants, in collaboration with the
        broader Espoo community. Additionally, the City Council has set the goal of making Espoo the
        foremost city for integration in Finland as part of its broader strategy (City of Espoo Integration Programme 2022-2025).</br></p>
      </div>
     </br>This project was done in collaboration with Trust-M. Trust-M is a research project that works in
      collaboration between Aalto University, University of Helsinki, Tampere University, and the City of
      Espoo. They aim to create trustworthy digital public services to improve the integration of migrants in
      Finland. Our focus within this seven-week Designing for Services course is the integration of stay-at-
      home mothers and their preferred information channels. During our project, Trust-M decided to focus
      on a new Hybrid Service Manual as their development goal.</br>

    <div class = "col0">
      <p class="large1"><b> Scope </b></p>
      This project helps mainly in the process of problem definition and contributed to design principles. The 
      research initially aimed to study the integration process of stay-at-home moms but faced challenges in reaching 
      them. We expanded our scope to include service providers working closely with this group. We focused our 
      interviews on preferred information channels and found that usage is influenced by personal and cultural factors, 
      with most information coming through family and community.</br>
      The final study explored how the Service Manual could improve communication between immigrants and service 
      providers. Through our co-creation workshop, we developed recommendations on the role of the Service Manual in 
      service communication. Despite challenges with multiple scopes, the insights gained through this process helped 
      us reach our final conclusions.</br>

      We used various methods to collect data, starting with desk research by reviewing materials from Trust-M and 
      additional sources on integration. We focused on stay-at-home mothers, a vulnerable group for integrating into 
      Finnish society, as they are harder to reach and use fewer integration services. We conducted four expert interviews 
      with Espoo and NGO workers, along with interviews of immigrants, especially women and mothers, to gain a deeper 
      understanding.</br>

      We organized in-depth interviews in <a href="https://www.nicehearts.com/in-english/"></br>
      Neighborhood Mothers</a>. We interviewed</br>
      four immigrant women and three of them </br>
      were mothers. We used the same materials</br>
      as in the Language café interviews. From</br>
      these interviews, one important takeaway</br>
      was to see how much the process of finding</br> 
      information varies between these women. </br>

      <p class="large1" style="width: 100%;" style="margin-top: 10rem;"><b> Findings </b></p>
      Stay-at-home mothers are falling out of the integration process. They have small social circles and there's a lack of suitable integration plan.
      There are some good practices emerging, like a network approach: Whoever finds a person in need of help, can direct them to Hello Espoo. The 
      findings are also concluded into following points:

          <div class="accordion-content" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
            Researching the lives of immigrant women clearly brought forward the softer side of immigration.
            Generally, learning the language and finding a job are seen as measurements of the level of
            integration, but there are also other ways of finding one's place and feeling at home.</br>
            <img src="images/p2-3/p3-4-0.png" alt="insight4" class = "col1pic">
            We asked immigrants to rate how integrated they feel (Figure 8). The graph shows that integration can happen 
            quickly or take time, and setbacks like racism can hinder it. When asked what would help them feel more at 
            home, most mentioned finding a job or learning the language.</br>

            Stay-at-home mothers face extra challenges in integrating. Their small social circles limit participation in 
            society, and fitting into the 3-year integration plan is difficult with young children. After three years, 
            they lose access to some services. Integration programs mainly target job seekers, with requirements like 25 
            hours of weekly study being hard for stay-at-home parents. Home care allowances also encourage mothers to stay home.</br>

            Face-to-face meetings remain crucial for sensitive issues like domestic violence, as phone or chat can't ensure 
            privacy or reveal who is speaking. In-person, skilled workers can detect hidden problems, and immigrants can 
            demonstrate their motivation, influencing the service they receive.</br>

            <b> Social contacts are the most important sources of information </b></p>
            There's a lot of diversity in the use of information channels. People prefer different platforms to gather
            information, however, we found that social support is universally important to get information. Family,
            friends, and the community are asked for guidance when searching for information. Social contacts
            are especially important for people who have less technical skills or language skills.

            Not having the right or up-to-date information can greatly influence the service experience. When it
            is not clear 'why' certain tasks need to be done, it can feel unnecessarily hard. Additionally, hearing
            about others' experiences can lead to misguided expectations, resulting in a sense of unfair treatment.
