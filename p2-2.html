          department in Aalto University. Under the theme “Making sense with more-than-human urban ecologies”, 
          <i>The Bedroom</i> was created. It is a sound narrative of a bedroom in the feral world of Espoo. It 
          is presented as a digital interface offering a sound narrative that captures the essence of my personal 
          space. Individuals can immerse themselves in the ambient sounds, providing a glimpse into my untamed 
          environment.This project has been exhibited in UROBOROS Festival in Prague National Gallery.</br></br></br>

              "Feral" comes from the latin term “ferus,” which means wild.</br>
              For example, feral species - once domesticated creatures that have returned to the</br>
              wild and become untamed, having unexpected impacts on the environment.</br>
              Can i be a feral creature?</br>
              “A situation in which an entity, nurtured and transformed by a human-made infrastructural </br>
              project, assumes a trajectory beyond human control.”</br>

              The Anthropocene continues to have a significant impact on Earth's ecosystems.</br> 
              Transformations towards more socially and ecologically sustainable ways of life are urgently </br>
              needed to address impacts of climate breakdown (Lee et al. 2023). Pathways towards necessary </br>
              changes to how we live together on the planet are contested and interdependent: they must go </br>
              beyond awareness raising campaigns and behaviour change to enable shifts in people's everyday </br>
              practices, lifestyles, productive means, and political systems. </br>
              An important role in understanding how to re-imagine and enact positive eco-social change is </br>
              played by creative practices in art and design. Creative practitioners and practice-based </br>
              researchers have long experimented with diverse approaches to support positive eco-social </br>
              action, showing that art and design are transformative, particularly by provoking situations </br>
              that bring together stakeholders into imaginative, reflective exchange (Dolejšová et al. 2021, </br>
              Houston et al. 2022, Irwin 2015, Light et al. 2019, Maggs & Robinson 2020, Neal 2015).</br>

        </p>
        My window is a bit broken, and my door allows leaks, unexpectedly exposing me to the cold wind and the surprisingly 
        loud rain while lying in bed.</br>
        But the nature is stunning. The reeds, the thin ice on the lake, tall trees, falling snowflakes.</br>
        In essence, these contrasting emotions represent an internal conflict within me. It is a fight between humanity's 
        inherent desire for a stable, enclosed dwelling and the innate love for wild nature within us. There exists a 
        fundamental and instinctual affection for nature in humans, a deep-seated inclination woven into our DNA. </br></br>

        To investigate these queries, I have adopted a method of immersing myself in the surroundings and thoroughly observing 
        the details. My approach involves concentrating on my emotions and capturing as much feral data as possible, guided by 
        drifting prompts.</br>

      <p style="margin-top: 0;">In the drifting process, the most feral data I've gathered are my sensory impressions, and they were 
        documented by subsequent note-taking or on-site recordings including audio, videos, and photos. Utilizing 
        this data allows me to characterize my feral place, identify my focal points, and potentially address the

        How does your cheek record a surface near you - how does it feel on this part of you? Do you notice something new?</br>
        Touch something you have never touched before. Is this something you usually avoid? Or just something you have never encountered before? Did anything surprise you about this touch?</br>
        Close your eyes. Listen to the sounds of the place around you. Map what you hear? Does it sound different than before? Capture it. </br>
        Trace your hand along a part of your body, and imagine this is the path of a bug. How would it understand this terrain of you? How can a scale shift someone’s perception of the world?</br>
        Notice how much space is between you and the nearest lifeform. How can you fill the space so the other creature notices?</br>
        Map the kinds of data being collected about you right here and now. Do the same for two other creatures near you. What data are being collected about you and things around you?</br>
        Become a tree. What have you witnessed through your lifetime? What might you witness in the future?</br>
        Imagine yourself as compost. What is the matter of you? What things have gone into making and nurturing you?</br>
        Imagine you are a seed in the ground. What are you looking for? What do you grow, with & for whom?</br>
        Where does your world start and end if you were a bird? Who is part of your world, who matters to you? Draw it.</br>
        How would you move if you had more than 2 legs? Try it.</br>
        What gifts are you giving the worlds around today? What gifts are they giving you?</br>
        Imagine you are a bird. What do you notice about humans?</br>
        Notice an other-than-human creature in your surroundings. Inhabit their rhythm. Capture it.</br>
        Find a place of stillness. Wait until another being encounters you. What happens when we pause? Can you comfortably wait until you are encountered by another?</br>
        Ask an other-than-human creature around you for the time. How might a day, a week, or a year be perceived by this creature?</br>

        <p>Sound stood out in the process as a effective medium to express my feeling of my feral place.</br>
        Sound is story telling</br>
        Sound leaves people space to imagine</br>
        They can overlap each other, making harmonies</br>
        They are more-than-human feral data, not like human laguages, they apply to other-than-human beings, too.</br>
        I recorded various sounds from my feral place, mapping them to different levels of 'feralness', evoking both comfort and discomfort.

          Ten audio clips have been carefully chosen to offer people an immersive experience of my environment,
          and these are featured on a webpage. Corresponding to each soundtrack, there are ten intentionally 
          blurred images serving as icons. The audio clips, ranging from 12 to 90 seconds, are set on continuous loops.
          </br>
          On the webpage, my goal is to narrate my deeply personal story and intimate feelings through sound in an 
          interactive manner. The design aims to serve as a link, allowing users to go on a journey to the distinct room 
          of a student at Aalto University, Otaniemi Campus, and for them to connect with and resonate with their own
          feral life.</br>
